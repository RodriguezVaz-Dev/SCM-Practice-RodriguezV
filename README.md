In the software engineering world, there will always come a time when multiple developers must work together. This can be very helpful because different minds have different solutions. Bringing new and other ideas that can help with the development of a project. However, this raises the question of how multiple developers would have the capacity to work with the same code and make the appropriate changes when needed. This is where SCM comes in. 

System Configuration Management (SCM) refers to "an arrangement of exercises that controls change by recognizing the items for change, setting up connections between those things, making/characterizing instruments for overseeing diverse variants, controlling the changes being executed in the current framework, inspecting and revealing/reporting on the changes made."-(System configuration management â€“ Software Engineering) 

GitHub is a well-known tool used by many developers. It makes SCM so much easier allowing users to be able to work together and either inspect each other codes or commit changes to the code. This is an easy process where developers can add others to their responsibilities and allow others to make those changes.
